That is, until he woke up in the legendary World of Cultivation, where martial artists fly through the skies and immortals battle over ancient treasures.

There's just one problem: Xiang Yu wants absolutely NONE of that action.

Armed with only his wits and a peculiar system that doubles his exp every 24 hours, Xiang Yu has one goal: become powerful enough to live in peace without getting involved in those ridiculous ""protagonist"" situations. No ancient tombs. No tournament arcs. And for heaven's sake, stay FAR away from anyone named Chen Mo, Lin Feng, or Li Yao—those names practically scream ""main character who will drag me into deadly situations!""

Starting with strength stats so pathetic he can barely lift a cultivation manual, Xiang Yu must somehow survive long enough for his exponential growth to matter. After all, doubling zero cultivation talent still equals zero... at first.

Follow Xiang Yu on his hilarious journey from zero to hero as he desperately tries to stay invisible while his power skyrockets beyond control! Watch as he dodges cultivation tournaments, avoids suspicious elders bearing gifts, and runs the other way whenever someone mentions ""ancient inheritance"" or ""chosen one.""

Join the adventure of the most reluctant cultivator in history whose only wish is peace and quiet, but whose exponential growth makes him the most terrifying force this cultivation world has ever seen!

Not only that, Lin Jia Yi insists on giving Lin Chu Xia her own apathetic and workaholic husband from the past life who rarely returned home.

There's a pinned review with many details on what you can expect from the story, but I'm going to answer here the one pressing question I imagine most of you will have:

Will the MC allow other men to see his harem members in action?

Initially, yes. But (SPOILER WARNING) he and his girls will come to a decision together in chapters 198-199, which is to appeal only to the female viewers because they need to increase the 'fangirl' stat to in turn increase the system's rank. From that point on, no males will be able to view their content.

As for the old content that's already out there, the system has a special quest for them, and if they nail it, that older material will be completely wiped from people's computers. It will cease existing altogether.

Alex was just another ordinary gamer—until the day he died. Struck down by a terminal illness, he found solace in his favorite game, a vast fantasy RPG filled with powerful warriors, intricate politics, and world-shaking events. But before he could see the game's ending, fate had other plans.

When he opens his eyes again, he’s no longer Alex from Earth. Instead, he’s Alex Dragonheart, a nameless extra in the very game he once played. Not a protagonist. Not even a villain. Just an unknown side character who was fated to die early, forgotten by history.

Armed with only half of the game’s knowledge, an unawakened bloodline, and a mysterious sealed skill, Alex is thrown into a brutal world where strength is everything. His beloved younger sister is sick and needs treatment, but his past self had been powerless to save her. Not anymore.

Determined to rewrite his fate, Alex will rise through the ranks, manipulate events from the shadows, and seize power that was never meant for him. If fate refuses to acknowledge him, then he’ll carve his own legend—one that even the gods will fear.

After all, in a world where only the strong survive, even an extra can become a nightmare.

When her ex-boyfriend leaves her for his mate and the truth of her adoption comes to light, Grace knows she has to leave… or die trying.

But her path to freedom slams into the Lycan King.

Cold, powerful, and burdened by the ghosts of a past he refuses to share, Caine doesn’t want Grace in his world. He doesn’t believe she belongs in any world but her own. And yet, with fate tethering their souls, his control begins to crack.

Grace never asked for his protection. She never asked to want him, either.

But something ancient is waking, and the deeper she dives into the truth of her past, the more she realizes: maybe she was never meant to be free. Maybe she was meant to change everything.

Starting with him.
----

*Grace of a Wolf* is the slightly unhinged romance between a human girl with inconvenient human morals and her mildly sociopathic fated mate—who also happens to be the Lycan King and has the emotional intelligence of a rock. Thankfully, their dangerously magnetic bond is (barely) balanced by found family chaos, a buttload of magic, and a fated mate connection that might actually kill her if they touch. Oops.

Just when you think you’re reading *yet another werewolf story*, the plot and worldbuilding sneak up behind you with claws, teeth, and actual stakes. It’s slow-burn, emotionally messy, and laced with the kind of tension that could kill—or kiss—you.

Confined to a hospital bed, chained by a body that betrayed him, he spent his days battling the cruel joke that was fate. But when a single video game shattered his last shred of patience, he found himself facing something even worse—his own reflection, cast into a story that should have never been his.

""Fucking NTR game!"" He said as he threw the console.

In the game, the player was nothing but a tragic figure. A weak, spineless fool, doomed to be discarded. A character whose sole purpose was to be broken.

But was that really all he was?

Thrown into a world that scorned him, Damien refuses to play by the script. If fate had already written his downfall, then he would carve his own path—one of defiance, of rage, of survival.

Watch as Damien, a man who once had nothing left to lose, fights to take control of a story that was never meant to be his.

Because in a world that demands he stay weak—he will either shatter expectations… or burn everything down with him.

On the day he experienced the most shocking betrayal of his life, as if that wasn't enough, he was beaten half-dead—and that was when the Infinite Wealth System awakened within him.

[System Activation Complete!]

[Congratulations, Jayden Cole. You have been chosen as the Host of the Infinite Wealth System.]

[Now let’s fix your miserable life!]

Thus, the Infinite Wealth System changed his life.

The system tasked him with completing many challenging missions—some that could even threaten his life or land him in grave trouble—but the rewards were mighty!

[Task #002: Buy the most expensive item in a luxury store. Pay in cash. Say, ‘Keep the change.’]

[Reward: 1 Million Dollars!]

---

[Task #004: Slap your troublesome landlord with a rent receipt and say, ‘I just bought your building.’]

[Reward: 5 Million Dollars!]

-------

[Task #005: Take a beautiful rich lady you never knew to a 5-star hotel and spend one week with her. You must nut her twice or more!]

[Reward: 20 Million Dollars!]

---

[Task #007: Attend a luxury auction. Outbid a billionaire on a Rolex and walk away without collecting it.]

[Reward: 15 Million Dollars!]

---

As the world’s most dangerous and outrageous missions begin piling up—from dismantling corporations to outwitting billionaires’ most important workers and daughters—one thing becomes clear:

Jayden won’t just climb the ladder of success. He’ll set fire to it and build his own throne at the top.

Power. Vengeance. Wealth. Women.
And one man bold enough to claim them all.

A world where female weavers command the very laws of reality and bend the elements to their will, while male warriors, blessed with monstrous strength, can shatter mountains with a single blow.

But there’s one problem. He’s somehow enrolled at Imperial Academy, the most prestigious weaver academy in the kingdom… which is supposed to be an all-girls school!

And as the only male weaver in an entire academy of talented (and terrifying) female weavers, his existence alone is enough to shatter the balance of the world.

With a suspiciously broken cheat, an entire school of powerful and competitive girls watching his every move, and curses lurking in the shadows, Ren must navigate this chaotic new life before he gets caught up in a story that was never meant to include him.

But maybe—just maybe—he can turn this anomaly into an advantage. And if fate allows, fulfill his lifelong dream of being surrounded by beautiful, ambitious women while he's at it.

Can he survive this world where he's the ultimate anomaly?

The Emperor had issued an official decree to appoint a successor to the throne—one who would become the next ruler of the empire.

But instead of a direct appointment, the successor would be determined through a formal battle among the princes and princesses.

A battle that would drag in many factions, overflow with conspiracies, claim countless lives, and reshape the entire continent... was about to begin.

But among the contenders, there was one prince who had no intention of fighting—Nolan.

Handsome, lazy, and utterly annoying, Nolan was well-known for the many unflattering titles given to him by those around him.

Nolan: ""Fighting to become emperor? Please... I just want to relax and enjoy life.""

Rather than compete, he convinced his twin sister to fight in his place while he supported her from behind the scenes.

Nolan: ""My dear sister, I leave my future in your capable hands!""

And with that, the prince’s journey toward a life of leisure—relying entirely on his sister—officially began.

Ethan Nocturne always thought he was just a regular guy in a world where everyone awakens superpowers at 18. But when his birthday comes, everything changes. His body feels stronger, his senses sharper, and women—especially the ones around him—start acting strangely, drawn to him in ways he doesn’t understand.

Then, the truth hits him—he’s not human. He carries the Incubus Bloodline, the rare male counterpart to a succubus. And his adoptive family? They’re not just powerful superhumans. His adoptive mom, Lilith Nocturne, is the Succubus Queen, and his three stunning stepsisters are Succubus Princesses—rulers of an entire fantasy planet.

But here’s the strangest part—they don’t know what he really is.

As Ethan struggles to make sense of his new reality, he learns that the world’s superpowers aren’t as simple as people believe. Fantasy creatures—elves, vampires, dragonkin, and more—aren’t just myths. They’re real. And they’ve been living in secret among humans.

Now, they’re appearing in his life, drawn to him for reasons he can’t explain. His bloodline, his awakening, and the system guiding him—it’s all connected to something much bigger.

Why have these races stayed hidden for so long? What is the real truth behind superpowers? And why does he feel like his very existence is meant to change everything?

With a system pushing him toward his incubus instincts, powerful women from all over the world—and beyond—falling into his orbit, and forces in the shadows watching his every move, Ethan has two choices—fight it or embrace it.

But one thing is clear—his life will never be the same again.

Think 'Squid Game' meets 'Game of Thrones'.

✧˖°── .✦───☼༺☆༻☾───✦.── °˖✧

In a kingdom where the crown is not passed down by blood, even a prince must earn it--and even a peasant can claim it.

Keiser was a knight, one of the first commoners to ever reach the final trial of the King’s Gambit, a brutal series of challenges devised by the king himself to choose his successor. While noble-born contenders trained their entire lives for this ruthless competition, Keiser, a man with no mana, defied all odds through sheer grit, loyalty, and unyielding strength.

At his side stood Prince Gideon Aury Valemont, the king’s fourth son, who had seemingly renounced his claim to support Keiser.

Or so Keiser believed.

At the final trial the truth was revealed.

Keiser had been nothing but a pawn. Gideon had used him as a shield, a decoy to draw out assassins and political threats, all while secretly paving his own path to the throne. The final trial demanded that a candidate’s chosen ally either make the ultimate sacrifice--or betray them and take the crown.

Gideon chose the crown.

Kneeling--bloodied, broken, impaled by the very sword that had once been his salvation, forged from the core of a dragon he had spared in his youth. Keiser remained upright only by the steel lodged in his chest. Smoke curled from his seared flesh, sigils burned into his skin by the hands he once trusted. And as the pain faded into numbness, he looked up...

To behold Gideon, crowned in gold and betrayal--a serpent in royal silk, enthroned by treachery and gilded lies.

In that final moment, Keiser understood. The King’s Gambit had never been about valor or justice. It was a game of shadows--a masquerade where victory belonged not to the strongest, but to the most ruthless deceiver.

But death was not the end.

Keiser awakens in the frail body of Muzio Auro Valemont, the king’s disgraced, long-missing bastard son, fated to die soon before the Gambit begins.

To stop history from repeating itself, Keiser must find himself, convince him that the betrayal is coming. That Gideon, the man he trusts most, will drive a blade through his heart.

Even if it means entering the Trials once more, in a body too weak to wield a sword, with magic too wild to control, and a name no one respects.

Keiser, now Muzio, must train, scheme, and survive--
Not as the knight who flew too close to the sun,
But as the bastard son hidden in its shadow.

He no longer seeks the crown.
He seeks to destroy all who dare to wear .

And he thought that the only reason he was alive is because he was not dead yet.

But then, at the age of 16, Cole developed a hobby.

And that's reading novels.

When he's reading, he feels emotions he normally wouldn't feel!

Cole feels like he's been brought into a different world!

And reading novels made him forget about the boredom he's feeling!

So he really enjoyed and liked novels!

To the point that he even started making one!

Yes, Cole became a novel author and his works were seen and read by many people around the world!

And seeing people talking about his work and supporting him made Cole enjoy writing too!

But after reading and writing novels again and again... for a long time.

Cole started to feel less excitement and thrill in doing them...

Nevertheless, he didn't stop.

Cole feels like he would be bored to death if he stop, so he just continued.

He received a mail...

The sender was anonymous and the content of it didn't make sense to him.

Big-money transfers fail to restore the club’s glory, forcing Ten Hag to shift his focus to homegrown talent.

Among the overlooked prospects in the U18 squad is Leo Calderon, a 17-year-old central midfielder buried deep in the pecking order.

Lacking physicality and dismissed by teammates as weak, Leo endures constant ridicule from those who dominate with strength and athleticism.

But during one ordinary training session, everything changes—Leo suddenly sees passing lanes no one else can, angles of play invisible to even the most talented prospects.

Yet, there’s a problem. His vision surpasses his ability. The passes he attempts don’t connect, his technique unable to match his newfound awareness.

Coaches dismiss his efforts as sloppy, and his struggles continue. But one unexpected observer—a visiting League One assistant coach—notices something different.

He watches Leo’s movements, seeing potential where others see failure.

As Leo fights to prove himself in an unforgiving system, the question lingers—can he refine his raw talent before the club moves on without him?

""Who would have thought that one ordinary review could instantly fuck your life? Definitely not me""

******

Luke was your average teenage boy, with an unhealthy obsession for light novels, rooted deep in some past truama.

After finishing a new read titled “The Hero’s Obsessed Harem,” he jumped online to post a review. His biggest issue? The so-called “hero” kept stealing other men’s love interests, and somehow, the story praised him for it.

Right after posting the review, he got an odd reply from the author:
“You think my book is flawed? I’ll make you regret that.”

Luke brushed it off as a salty writer who couldn’t handle criticism, until everything went dark.

The next time he opened his eyes, he was in the body of Riven Von Grave, the fourth son of the low-ranking Grave baron family, an irrelevant extra in The Hero’s Obsessed Harem. Riven was a forgotten character, engaged to three duke’s daughters since childhood, only for all three to abandon him for the so-called hero. And to make matters worse, he was fated to die in a war against demons, utterly forgotten.

But Luke isn’t having any of it.

Screw fate.
Screw the plot.
And most of all, screw the author who threw him into this mess.

Armed with a mysterious system and pure spite, Riven is going to rewrite his destiny, and win back his fiancées as well.

But with every change Riven makes, he changes the story, and pulls a calamity bigger than the demons toward them.

Nakagawa Haruki thought marriage would bring him happiness. He had been in love with Satomi since high school, and after years of struggling together, they finally built a stable life. But stability came with a price.

Satomi was always busy. Work became her priority, and Haruki… was left behind. The warmth of their relationship faded, and intimacy became a distant memory. Nights felt colder, the bed emptier—even when she was right beside him.

Loneliness gnawed at him.

Then everything changed when Satomi’s family invited him to stay at their luxurious home.

Seven Witches. Seven Sins.

Mel Sakura had transmigrated into the World of Witchhunter's Howl, a gacha game she used to play, reborn as the Witch of Lust, fifteen years before the apocalyptic timeline.

Upon waking up, the System (who had kidnapped her in the first place) offered her a choice: Return to her original World, or stay and prevent the six Witches’ tragedies that led to the Witches’ Uprising.

“Oh? Then can I go home now?”

[ ...of course. I’m sorry for everything. Please stand still as I prepare the ritual. ]

“Hehe. I’m just kidding.” The Witch of Lust grinned, her cheeks tinged with red. “Why so eager to send me back? Don’t ruin my only chance for graduating from my Virginity, would you?”

So, with a full-blown Harem Plan in mind, a decade had passed since she finally resolved the Witch of Envy’s tragedy. And suddenly, the Witch of Pride broke through the Saintess’s Seal for a moment just to call the System a liar.

She should have really, really heeded that warning from the start. Or at least be more prepared for when the System finally revealed herself, and trapped her after she’d seduced them all…

“Um...Partner? Don’t you think you can let me out of the basement already?”

“Too late, Mel... Don’t worry. I will make you feel so good you’ll forget why you ever tried to save them.”

“Hic... just don’t shred my panty like last time...”

This is a fluffy, lighthearted fairy tale where everything finally aligned. The Witches. The Happy Ending. The welcomed Witches Uprising. And a System that finally had its wish granted:

A simple date in the Capital.

(So this is death?!!)

I, Elysia, found myself dead before even reaching the Demon King's lair, and our Hero Party was completely annihilated.

And this was done by none other than a fellow human—my former classmate.

He had been mostly invisible during our time at the academy, but then he started committing one crime after another until he became a lackey of the Demon King.

Who would have thought that the strongest party of humanity would be wiped out by humanity’s traitors?

(If I could go back to the past, I swear I will kill you!)

Just when I thought I could finally pass on, I opened my eyes.

Five years back, when I first enrolled at Arcadia Academy.

And there he was, the traitorous bastard of humanity...

“Huh? Where am I?”

One day, I opened my eyes to find myself in an unfamiliar place and came to realize this was the world within the novel Savior's Dawn that I had read.

Everything seemed to be proceeding the same as in the novel—except for one thing.

But as a broke teenager struggling to even pay his rent, how could he possibly use it?

“Your father has been missing for over a year. As per his will, you are to inherit all his assets,” they said.

To his shock, Logan learns that he was the sole heir of the Mercer family fortune — and with it came control of major businesses, unimaginable wealth... and the constant threat of his father’s competitors.

“System, redeem one billion dollars,” Logan said.

In the vast world of cultivation, where honor and integrity reign supreme, one man dares to defy the heavens—not with sword or spell, but with deception and trickery.

Once a lowly street urchin, Han Yu quickly realized that cultivation required three things: talent, resources, and powerful backers. He had none of those. What he did have, however, was a sharp tongue, quick hands, and a complete lack of shame.

From gambling dens to immortal auctions, from conning sect elders to running an interdimensional insurance scam, Han Yu’s reputation spreads across the cultivation world like an unstoppable plague.

No treasure is too sacred, no contract too ironclad, and no oath too unbreakable for him to twist to his advantage. Even the mighty Immortal Clans dare not underestimate him—after all, the last sect that tried ended up legally belonging to him.

With a growing list of enemies, a debt larger than some celestial empires, and a skillset that consists entirely of loopholes, misdirection, and sheer audacity, Han Yu’s journey to the peak of immortality is anything but conventional.

Will he be hunted down by every major power in the realm? Will he accidentally scam his way into becoming an Immortal Emperor? Or will he outwit even fate itself and make the heavens owe him a favor?

One thing is certain—when Han Yu is involved, nothing is ever fair, but the house always wins.

Two millennials ago, Earth underwent an earth-shattering change.

The gods were slaughtered by an unknown terrifying existence, and their potent blood spilled through the entire solar system, corrupting all life on various planets along with Earth.

As a last resort, the gods created the Galactic Tower. Their inheritances, strength, and relics were placed as rewards for those who cleared each floor, proving themselves worthy.

…

Lucian Morningster, the golden boy of the city. He had a perfect life, had the prettiest girl, a good best friend and a very bright future.

However, everything changed when he awakened an F-rank talent instead of the expected S-rank talent.

“It must be a mistake?”

“See? I told you he would awaken a trash talent.”

“All that potential, for an F-ranker?”

His girlfriend who awakened a C-rank talent, “What a waste, Lucian. My father took you in for nothing!”

His best-friend who awakened an A-rank talent, “You know, seeing you so weak and vulnerable is kind of refreshing. She always hated your endless confidence, so do I. It’s no wonder she comes to me after being done with you.”

Lucian, who was respected and envied now turned to a joke to the entire school and town.

“Boom!”

Those who he called friends attacked him, leaving him for dead in the Galactic Tower.

A world where magic reigns supreme and the mightiest wizards stand at the apex.

A world where one’s mana affinity, if one even had it, determines one’s status in society, whether one could soar through the skies like a dragon or remain grounded, scraping by like rats or chickens.

This was the world Hal Fennec was born into.

Raised in the poverty of a border village, Hal had one wish: to give his mother a better life, one free from the constant fear of beast attacks and invasions by the Fellkin.

But fate seemed to be playing a cruel joke.

Despite being the brightest and most confident among his peers since childhood, Hal turned out to be barely qualified to become a wizard.

His natural talent, contrary to his expectations, was nowhere near enough to fulfill even his modest dream of a decent city life.

But then, just when his final hope was snuffed out and the future seemed gray and bleak, a twist of fate—or more fittingly Chaos—granted him a system that would turn everything around.

“Time takes all away,” he thought.

A world of cultivation, ancient magic, divine beasts, and horrifying existences.

Resigned to a mortal’s fate, he thought he'd be powerless once again...

[Elemental Affinity – TIME]

But in this new life, power alone isn’t enough.

The world is crawling with ancient races and corrupted sects, like the mysterious Black Rain Pavilion, known for manipulating time cultivators.

Threats of betrayal swirl even within those closest to him, and a hidden mastermind seems to know every step Kranos takes before he even takes it, constantly plotting to kill him.

As beasts awaken from slumbers and timelines fracture, Kranos must race against fate itself.

""With the power of time in my hands, I will conquer all.""

He sighed as he stood against four ancient immortals, their killing intent crashing down like divine thunder.

Little did they know… he had already seen this moment before.

Only one person remained: Riley—the weakest warrior of them all, forgotten within all the chaos.

But he saw through the Demon Lord’s deception. The demon was on the brink of death—so weak even a fly could’ve finished him off.
And Riley did just that, drawing every last ounce of strength to bite off the demon’s head.

Victory? Not quite. A final, desperate strike from the Demon Lord pierced him from behind, killing him instantly.

But fate wasn’t done with him yet.

Riley awoke ten years in the past—when the online game [Apocalypse] was launched. Before demons descended. Before monsters overran the world.

And this time, he wasn’t starting from nothing. He had a decade of experience—and a second chance.

Even more shocking, he didn’t awaken his old D-rank Strength Boost talent. This time, he received something far more terrifying: an SSS-Rank Gluttony talent!

He could now devour anything—monsters, items, talents, even traits—and gain their power.

Ding!

Now, there is no demon, no god, no monster who will stand in his way. He will devour everything—and save the world.

But the power of Gluttony was a double edged sword. If he wasn’t careful… he could be the one getting consumed.

Even more absurd, interns who come to work always mysteriously ""resign,"" leaving only a calm and composed butler who hands her a new labor contract with a smile every day.

Raven wakes up as the protagonist of his favorite novel. He knows the brutal storyline that makes grown men weep.

The original protagonist endured it all, but Raven has no plans to play along.

He has a system, but that broken thing has everything locked.

He has knowledge of the plot, but no clue what twists the author hid beyond what he read.

He has a choice to suffer like before or rewrite everything.

The tragic twists? Fuck them

The heartbreaking losses? Skip them

Pointless sacrifices? Save them

No more misery for the sake of character growth.

This time, he is writing his own legend and a story worth remembering!

What you can get from the story: -

1. A good laugh.

2. A harem that isn't braindead.

3. An MC who grows (both physically and mentally) as the story goes.

4. An MC who wants to avoid trouble, no matter what kind it is as he already has a lot of trouble in his life, but that doesn't mean he would smile if you insult him (he ain't a pushover).

5. A plot where every character would feel alive.

6. A plot with no yuri or NTR; those are not my cup of tea.

Humanity learned that they weren't alone in the universe, but that wasn't something they had the time to worry about.

Their realization was accompanied by catastrophe.

Creatures beyond their wildest imaginations poured down from the sky and appeared from the earth. They slaughtered humans as if it was their singular purpose, driving them to the brink of extinction.

The people of the world did everything in their power, developing unique traits and technologies to create a united front their enemies couldn't penetrate.

They secured victories and repopulated, feeling as if they stood a chance against the foreign invaders.

They fought and they fought, doing everything they possibly could to ensure their survival.

Until the Great Calamities appeared.

In front of them, humanity was nothing regardless of its efforts.

One by one, the worlds were turned into piles of rubble in between the cracks of their teeth. Civilization was torn apart, and the evolved humans living within could do nothing to stop its collapse.

Humanity itself was left extinct, and in the end, only a single man was left alive amidst the chaos.

Why?

For what reason were they punished so?

Nobody knew why the attacks began in the first place.

He looked into the distance at the memories of the past and firmed his resolve.

“It can only be me.”

He knew of a miracle that could return him to the place of those memories.

He knew of a way to make the wheels of time spin in reverse.

And using it, he alone would save humanity from its doomed fate.

That was his sacred duty as its final survivor.

Soon after, he wakes up in the body of a fourth prince who had been poisoned by one of his brothers.

As though that wasn’t scary enough, Austin later discovers that he has somehow become entangled in a dangerous political situation where his brothers would do anything to become the next emperor.

However, this turned out to be the least of his problems because Austin realizes that, unlike his three older brothers, the fourth prince had never once taken a liking to combat or training, making him the weakest out of the four princes.

So, how is Austin expected to survive in a world filled with magic, monsters, barbarians, demons, and an internal battle over the succession of the throne?

With a long, depressed sigh, Austin groaned as he lay on his bed and stared sightlessly at the ceiling.

“Ugh, what am I going to do now?” he pondered. But there was only one thing he could do if he wanted to live a happy and peaceful life in this fantasy world.

He travels through the space and universe, fucks the bad guys (not literally), fucks the beautiful girls (literally), absorbs their powers through dual cultivation, and rises to become a being even gods fear.

Long Synopsis-

Xavier was nothing—a poor, bullied loser who got beaten for fun, ignored like trash, and laughed at like he wasn’t even human. Living at the bottom of society. No power, no money, no future. That changed the day a ancient goddess responded to his prayers and made him a God.

Now armed with the Unlimited Money System, Xavier can buy anything. His balance is infinite. Money rains when he speaks. He can buy power, respect, empires, cities, loyalty, fear—anything. If it exists, he can afford it.

To unlock his true power as a God, Xavier must gather the fragments of the fallen goddess—each one hidden across galaxies, buried in ancient vaults, or locked behind wars, politics, and secrets. Every piece brings him closer to rewriting reality itself.

He could absorb the powers hidden inside beautiful women, each more dangerous—and alluring—than the last.

From humiliating the rich elite to breaking into galactic vaults, from building a harem of deadly wives to rewriting the rules of interstellar war… Xavier’s path to legend has no brakes.


Follow Xavier as he rises from nothing, and becomes not only the richest man in the universe—but also the most feared.

*_+_+_+_*

Note- This is a harem novel, but the focus is on Xavier’s revenge and rise—not just the girls. Romance happens naturally. No rape, no ntr, no yuri.

The system won't be giving quest like fuck this girl and fuck that girl. But if Xavier wants to seduce a girl he likes, the system will help him by giving relevant quests.

I have also included fantasy races like vampires, dragons, werewolves, elves, etc. as a species of space. I won't be spoiling more than that. I just wanted you guys to know what you were getting into before you read this novel, and what to expect from it.

But before these blessings came a curse.

An alien face appeared from nowhere and threatened all life on the planet, leading to the greatest war in human history.

In the aftermath, the human race and the alien race were forced into a shaky treaty that could be broken at any time.

Years later, tests for summoning abilities began for the next generation. Those who awakened low-grade summoning would be thrown to the gutters, while those who awakened higher got to join great factions after graduating from the academy.

Kairos Veyl, the blank, calculating student, pulled his hand from the massive crystal pillar and stared at the large beast before him.

""This kid—he just got a LEGENDARY SUMMON.""

A legendary summon? The greatest class of summoning. However, with this class came a risk one would have never guessed.

*****

Watanabe Hiro and his friend, Owen were survivors of Zombie apocalypse and Black Dawn, a catastrophic event where the sun itself turned against humanity, scorching the earth and leaving only ashes in its wake.

But death was not the end. Hiroshi woke up not in the burning wastelands of Earth, but in the grand hall of a noble estate, surrounded by stone pillars and robed figures.

He found himself in the body of Axelius Dravenhart, the seven-year-old of the Noble Family of Dravenhart, renowned across the Kingdom of Archantia as the Greatest Beast Tamers for generations.

Yet, his new life was far from a blessing. Axelius was labeled a disgrace from birth: No mana core, mana-less, unblessed, and shunned during the grand Awakening Ceremony—a moment where nobles discover their affinities, whether it be Elemental Magic, Weapon Mastery, Spiritual Arts, or Beast Taming.

In a world dominated by powerful abilities and prestigious bloodlines, Axelius was nothing more than a powerless shadow, ignored by his own family and ridiculed by noble society.

But Hiroshi was no ordinary soul. Armed with the memories of surviving Apocalypse and the instincts of a fighter, he soon discovered a dark hidden power.

While the Dravenharts prided themselves on taming majestic beasts, Hiroshi, now Axelius, held the power to tame the untamable: Monsters. These terrifying creatures, feared from civilization for their uncontrollable nature, would bend to his will.

The Dravenhart legacy of taming would not be denied to him not by blood, nor by fate.




--------
BEASTS - Magestic,noble creatures, sacred companions of tamers.
MONSTERS – Chaotic, often corrupted creatures. Dangerous, untamable by normal methods. Feared by society.

As demons attacked the world, one of the most feared villains known to mankind escaped his prison.

For the past decade, the high-security containment zone, ""The Abyss,"" had held him captive. But recent demon attacks forced the transfer of essential prison personnel, weakening its security.

Seizing this opportunity, Oliver Thorne escaped.

Contrary to expectations, he displayed no anger, rage, or remorse, instead heading directly for the heart of the demon army.

The blood of the fallen rose like a tsunami, merging with him as he flew across the sky.

He reached the center of the demon army.

Suddenly, the world turned crimson.

An enormous energy wave tore through space and time, shredding the strongest demons into dust.

More blood erupted, fueling further explosions.

Until everything was reduced to dust.

The crimson devil, the supposedly unkillable villain, finally perished. But, unknown to him, fate had other plans.

After death, Oliver Thorne was sent to his teenage years. The time before he became a villain.

What would he do with the unexpected second chance he received?

And even though everything is set as it should be, there are things lurking behind the shadows, manipulating it as they seem fit.

And perhaps, at the edge of this chaotic, unbalanced, broken world, there also lies salvation to those who crave for it?

Or maybe… it’s all just facade hiding the calamities that would soon consume the world.


…

In the World of Zarraf, there lives Gods, not all goods are good and certainly none are without motives.

They rule the world’s 7 nations:

The Nation of Light and Sun
The Nation of Water
The Nation of Fire
The Nation of Life
The Nation of Earth
The Nation of Moon
The Nation of Wind

Each ruled by a Goddess that has their own stance in their ruling.

But that is only the first page of this world.

The second page colors the Ancient Gods of Corruption, Rage, Curse, Death and Hate.

The third belongs the Seven Sins’ Incarnations that are ready to succeed the Ancient Gods.

The Fourth is of the Witches who stand against all Gods equally.

And the Final Page colors the [Immortals] or otherwise known as [Players] that will be summoned to bring Chaos to this world.

A World that was meant to be destroyed, such is the fate of the world of Zarraf as powers beyond the realm of mortals threaten the dynamic equilibrium of their existence.

In the end, the world was prophesied to be destroyed by one cause or another. Nothing could prevent looming destruction…

Or so it was supposed to happen..

Arthur's head hurt like crazy as he woke up. He kept his eyes closed, rubbing his temples and feeling a super comfy bed under him - definitely not his cheap mattress back home.

""What the hell...?"" he mumbled as he finally looked around.

He was in some rich person's bedroom with a fancy four-poster bed and red silk sheets. Sunlight came through pretty stained glass windows, making red patterns on the marble floor.

Everything screamed royalty - fancy mirrors, portraits of hunting scenes, and even a painting of a barely-dressed goddess that seemed to be watching him.

""How did I get here?"" Arthur wondered, getting out of bed. ""I definitely drank too much at Mark's party last night""

The last thing he remembered was almost getting hit by a car while crossing the street.

Looking in a mirror, he got another shock. He didn't look like himself at all! Instead of being skinny with acne scars, he now had muscles, clear skin with just one cool scar on his jaw, with a reddish brown hair, and green eyes.

""Damn, I'm hot,"" he said, touching the scar.

For a moment, he remembered his old life. He pushed up his glasses. Kids made fun of him. Jessica laughed at him when he asked her out. ""Like I'd be with a loser like you,"" she told him.

Suddenly Arthur realized what was happening. ""I've been transported to another world! Just like in those stories online!""

He spun around excitedly. ""I must be someone important here. This is gonna be so cool! Watch out, fantasy world, your new hero has arrived!""

Right then, blue text appeared floating in front of him:

[System Starting Up...]

[Soul Check: Person from Another World]

""Incubus?"" Arthur asked in shock. ""Like, those demons that seduce people?""

[That's right. Your family's magic has changed because of your Earth soul's hidden desires. Congrats on finding your true potential.]

""Can I change it? I want to be a cool battle wizard or something!""

[Not possible. Your soul has permanently connected to the Incubus powers. Accept it - your charm is your weapon, attraction is your shield.]

""Fuck,"" Arthur groaned.

[Exactly. The more sexual intimacy you have, the stronger you'll become.]

""Is there a genuine solution, or are humanity and even its gods trapped in cycles of suffering?""

Jorel Ujochi, a proud noble who is determined to reform the system from within later on, suddenly finds fighting invisible horrors, and god power individuals and also his own arrogance.

Meanwhile, Marichi, a masked enigma and 'slum gutter rat' who seeks to dismantle the system entirely, battles not just external abominations but the chilling voices of his past that prey on his mind.

This unprecedented balance of forces places him at the center of a cosmic struggle, where no mortal has ever dared to tread.

As Aric navigates this perilous path, he must master his inner turmoil and wield his extraordinary gifts to restore harmony to a world on the brink of chaos.

Apocalypse Vault: 14 Girllss and Me (I'm Alone in this Apocalypse Vault with 14 Girls)

Jin finds himself waking up in a hidden underground vault, feeling totally lost and having no idea about his past. The only thing he can hear is a mysterious AI voice guiding him, and it keeps telling him one thing: survive.

Outside, the world has ended. Inside, beautiful girls sleep in cryo-pods, waiting to be awakened.

But here's the problem—Jin's not some badass protagonist. He's just a guy with a rusty pipe and the personality of an overly helpful golden retriever. As he takes on zombies, does push-ups, and picks up new skills, he somehow gets stronger through a game-like system that leaves him totally confused.

With nothing but determination, a slightly more bent pipe, and an AI buddy who loves to tease him even more than the monsters outside, Jin has to figure out the secrets of the vault while looking out for the girls who became his new family.

Known for his perpetual scowl and biting remarks, he's labeled a ""problem child"" by caretakers and ""damaged goods"" by potential adopters. Years of rejection have built thick armor around his young heart.

In death, he encounters the God of Balance who offers him a second chance at life in a different world—this time as Grim Van Ambrose, son of a noble house. Balance explains that every soul deserves to know love and connection, something Elias was cruelly denied in his first life.

Promised the family and belonging he never experienced, Grim begins his new life only to suffer an immediate tragedy: his mother dies moments after his birth. This cruel twist of fate reinforces his belief that loss is inevitable, leaving him with a distant father and the mysterious voice of a ""Guidance Assistant"" in his head.

As Grim grows into his new identity, he struggles with his dual nature—the emotional scars of his past life bleeding into his present one. His difficult personality and sharp tongue remain, now paired with noble privilege and expectations. Despite his outward brashness, he carries the deep wounds of his first life and the fresh loss that welcomed him into his second.

What begins as one orphan's second chance evolves into an epic journey through a world of ancient beasts, elemental magic, and deadly political intrigue. As Grim uncovers the truth about the Ambrose Clan's fall from grace and the conspiracy that framed them for treason, he faces increasingly dangerous adversaries—both human and monstrous. His quest for revenge against those who destroyed his family's legacy will challenge him to master forbidden techniques, forge unexpected alliances, and ultimately decide whether to rebuild the Ambrose Clan as it was, or transform it into something entirely new.

I was the strongest player in the world—until they betrayed me.

When I woke up, I wasn’t a player anymore. I was just an NPC. A nameless mob, doomed to be farmed for EXP and discarded like trash.

But then, I heard it:

(You have been killed.)
(Unique Skill Activated: Infinite Resurrection.)
(Each death makes you stronger.)

Every time a player slaughters me, I steal their stats, their skills, and their power. I evolve beyond the system’s control, beyond the limits of this world.

They thought I was nothing.
They thought they could use me, farm me, erase me.

Now, I am the final boss—and I will make them suffer.
On the battlefield, and in my bed.

They will submit. One way or another.",296 Chapters,https://book-pic.webnovel.com/bookcover/32243415908019705?imageMogr2/thumbnail/600x&imageId=1744236612360

""Damn it, why the hell am I the Villainess?""

Petra, a human resources manager, just went through a painfully dumb breakup. To cope? She did what any sane woman would. Binge-read a guilty pleasure romance and smut novel series from her teenage years, only to realize that the heroines have brain-cell-deficiency.

One way led to another, she wakes up as Verena D’Auvergne—a minor antagonist who turned out to be the ultimate villainess of the whole series after an incident. The very woman who stole all the love interests and died trying!

""Forget the male leads, I have to make the heroines forgive me!""

Can she, the ultimate villainess, capture the forgiveness of the very women she was meant to destroy? Or will the cursed System, and fate itself, force her to chase after love?

Who am I?

Majority of humans despise dark mages. They associate dark magic with the monsters. Light magic is celebrated the most.

I am the son of the most powerful wizard of light and witch of darkness.

I am the force that will transform humanity from pure survival to a flourishing society. They call me the Emperor of Humanity.

What is the cost of this power?

As a successful author, Max was used to hate comments—but he never expected that his decision to kill an important character would lead to his own death.

Apparently, a Goddess and her brother used to read his novels and were huge fans of his work. Sadly, the brother didn't like Max’s latest plot twist... so he killed him.

As compensation, the Goddess decides to send Max into his own novel as the protagonist, with one mission: complete the story without letting any of the main characters die.

Max has no problem with that—he even has a request of his own.

""Can I court you?""

Now, the Goddess accompanies him in the form of the Ultimate Leveling System. Not only that, but the system also rewards him whenever he saves one of the fan-favorite characters. What could be better than this life?

[You have slain the Giant Behemoth Dragon. 200,000 EXP granted.]
[You have saved the side character, Charlotte Sinclair. Reward: Fortune of the Corelhelm Kingdom.]

Watch as the author builds a harem of his favorite characters while leveling up endlessly!
